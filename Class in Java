Define "Class" in Java.
Class is a Structured Layout which generates Objects.
Class is a collection of Variables, Methods, Blocks, Constructors, and main().

We use the "class" keyword to declare classes in Java:-
Structure of class:-
class Class_name
{
  //Varaibles
  //Methods
  //Blocks
  //Constructors
  //Main()
}

In Java main() has the following pre-defined format
public static void main(String args[])

In Java, the class_name starts with an uppercase letter.
