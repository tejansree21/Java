# Datatypes in Java

The types of data that we expect as input to Java programs are known as Datatypes.
Datatypes in Java are categorized into 2 types
1. Primitive Datatypes
2. NonPrimitive Datatypes

1. Primitive Datatypes

The "single-valued data formats" are known as Primitive datatypes.
These Primitive datatypes are categorized into 4 types:- 
(a) Integer Datatype
The numeric data which represented without decimal points.
These Integer Datatypes are categorized into four types:-
1. byte 
2. short
3. int
4. long


(b) Float Datatype
The numeric data is represented with decimal points.
These Float Datatypes are categorized into two types:- 
1. float
2. double


(c) Character Datatype
The single-valued character is represented in single quotes.
'c', 'f', 'g' etc.,

(d) Boolean Datatype
The data which represented in the form of true or false is known as a boolean datatype.


Note:- 
=>Byte and short Datatypes are used for multimedia data or Stream data.
=>Int is used for normal programming.
=>Long datatype is used to hold biggest numbers like phone numbers, account numbers, etc.,
=>To assign a long value we must use L or l in the RHS of declaration
  ex:- long l = 63036767000L;
=>float datatype is used in normal programming.
=>To assign float-value we must use F or f in the RHS of decalration.
  ex:- float F = 23.3f;
=> Double is used to hold the largest scientific calculated value.


2. Non-Primitive Datatypes

The group-valued data formats are known as Non-Primitive Datatypes.

These Non-Primitive datatypes are categorized into four types:-
a. Class
b. Interface
c. Array
d. Enum


define String Datatype?
String in Java is a Non-Primitive datatype which is a sequenced collection of characters represented in double quotes.
