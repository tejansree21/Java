# Variables

=>Variables are the data holders in the program.
=>Based on datatype,the variables in Java are categorized into two types:

1.Primitive DataType variables
2.NonPrimitive DataType variables

1.Primitive DataType variables:

=> The variables which are declared with primitive datatypes like byte,short,int,long,float,double,char,boolean are known as Primitive DataType Variables.
=> These Primitive datatype variables will hold values.

2.NonPrimitive DataType variables:
=> The variables which are declared with NonPrimitive datatypes like Class,Interface,Array and Enum are known as NonPrimitive datatype or Referential datatypes.
=> These NonPrimitive datatype variables will hold Object references or Object addresses.

"static" keyword in Java:
=> "static" keyword in java,specify the location of component-memory in class or object.

=> Based on &quot;static&quot; keyword the variables in Java are categorized into two types:
1.static variables
2.NonStatic variables

1.static variables:
=> The variables which are declared with &quot;static&quot; keyword outside the methods are known as &quot;static variables&quot; or Class variables
=> These static variables can be accessed with class_name.

2. Non static variables
=> The variables which are declared without the "static" keyword are known as non static variables.
=> Non static variables are categorized into two types:
(a) Instance variables
(b) Local variables
