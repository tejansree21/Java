# Variables

=>Variables are the data holders in the program.
=>Based on datatype, the variables in Java are categorized into two types:

1.Primitive DataType variables
2.NonPrimitive DataType variables

1.Primitive DataType variables:

=> The variables that are declared with primitive datatypes like byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean are known as Primitive DataType Variables.
=> These Primitive datatype variables will hold values.

2.NonPrimitive DataType variables:
=> The variables that are declared with NonPrimitive datatypes like Class, Interface, Array, and Enum are known as NonPrimitive datatypes or Referential datatypes.
=> These NonPrimitive datatype variables will hold Object references or Object addresses.

"static" keyword in Java:
=> "static" keyword in Java, specify the location of component-memory in a class or object.

=> Based on &quot;static&quot; keyword the variables in Java are categorized into two types:
1. static variables
2.NonStatic variables

1. static variables:
=> The variables which are declared with &quot;static&quot; keyword outside the methods are known as &quot;static variables&quot; or Class variables
=> These static variables can be accessed with class_name.

2. Non static variables
=> The variables which are declared without the "static" keyword are known as non-static variables.
=> Non-static variables are categorized into two types:
(a) Instance variables
(b) Local variables

(a) Instance variables
The non-static variables which are declared outside of the methods are known as Instance variables.
The instance variables will get the memory within the object and can be accessed with the object name.

(b) Local Variables
The non-static variables which are declared inside of the methods are known as Local Variables.
These Local variables will get memory inside the method and be accessed inside the method only.




Example Program on Variables

class DemoVariables 
{
  static int a = 10;    #static variables
  int b = 12;    #Instance varibale
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    int c = 30;  #Local Variable
    DemoVariables ob = new DemoVariables();
    System.out.println("a value:" +DemoVariables.a);
    System.out.println("b value:" +ob.b);
    System.out.println("c value:" +c);
  }
}



Define static Local variable.
=> There is no concept of static local variables in Java because static variables mean memory in class and cannot get memory at the method level giving compilation error.

Define  Global variables in Java.
=> There is no concept of global variables cause the variables are either class or object or method level.
